# Extension Template

Create Node App extension template.

> Extension description here.

## Dependencies

This section is needed in case of depending on other extensions. For example, `redux` extension is needed to use `redux saga`.

## How to use

Detail how the crwp command should be executed to add your extension, e.g:

```sh
$ npx crwp my-app --extend=Create-Node-App/extension-template@master#type=src
```

## Docs

It would be great if you detail why you use your extension, what things it adds to the generated boilerplate and incompatibilities with known extensions if necessary.
